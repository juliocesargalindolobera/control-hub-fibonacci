# Fibonacci API

## Overview

The Fibonacci API is a simple REST-like API that calculates Fibonacci numbers for a given index. This project is implemented using the Flask framework in Python.

## Technical Decisions

### Language and Framework

I chose Python and Flask for this project due to their simplicity and ease of use for creating RESTful APIs. Python is widely used for web development, and Flask is a lightweight framework that allows us to quickly set up a RESTful service.

### Fibonacci Calculation

The Fibonacci calculation is implemented using an iterative approach, as it is more efficient than a recursive approach for larger values of 'number'. This approach calculates Fibonacci numbers in O(n) time complexity, where 'number' is the index.

### Error Handling and Input Validation

The API handles errors and input validation in a straightforward manner. It checks for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or negative values) and returns appropriate error messages with HTTP status codes.

## Usage

To run the Fibonacci API, follow these steps:

1. Install Flask if not already installed:
   
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python fibonacci_api.py
   ```

3. The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000/fibonacci`. You can make GET requests to this endpoint by providing the `n` parameter, e.g., `http://localhost:5000/fibonacci?number=10`.

## Future Optimizations

Here are some optimizations that could be considered for improving the initial solution:

1. **Caching**: Implement a caching mechanism to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers for faster retrieval, especially for frequently requested indices.

2. **Logging**: Add logging to capture API usage and errors for monitoring and debugging purposes.

3. **Unit Testing**: Develop unit tests to ensure the correctness of the Fibonacci calculation and API endpoints.

4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or ReDoc to help users understand how to use the API.

5. **Input Validation**: Enhance input validation to handle edge cases more robustly and securely.

## Conclusion

The Fibonacci API project provides a basic implementation of a REST-like API for calculating Fibonacci numbers at a given index. It can serve as a starting point for more complex web services and can be extended and optimized based on specific use cases and requirements.
